Code for paper MICCAI2022 paper "Evidence fusion with contextual discounting for multi-modality medical image segmentation".

We propose a new deep framework allowing us to merge multi-MRI image segmentation results using the formalism of Dempster-Shafer theory while taking into account the reliability of different modalities relative to different classes.
